**Emotion Detection Through Text**
Emotion Detection Through Text is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to classify emotions from textual input using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to detect six key emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.

**Key Features**

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and processes text data using tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

Emotion Detection: Detects and categorizes emotions using a Random Forest Classifier model.

User Interface: A Flask-based GUI allows users to input text and receive real-time emotion predictions.

**Technologies Used**

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Flask

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree

**Project Structure**

Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization.

Feature Extraction: Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF.

Model Training: Trains the Random Forest Classifier and evaluates it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

GUI Development: Implements a Flask interface for easy interaction with the model.

**Future Enhancements**

Improved Accuracy: Further tuning of the model for higher precision in emotion detection.

Support for Additional Emotions: Expand the system to detect a broader range of emotions.

Deployment: Host the app online for wider access.
